# 🎤 Voice Chat Setup Guide - Daily.co + OpenAI Whisper

## Overview

Your voice chat has been **completely redesigned** to eliminate the Web Speech API network errors. The new architecture uses:

- **Daily.co** for reliable audio streaming infrastructure
- **OpenAI Whisper** for accurate speech-to-text processing
- **Cartesia** for high-quality text-to-speech responses

## ✅ What's Fixed

### ❌ Old Issues (RESOLVED)
- ~~Web Speech API "network" errors~~
- ~~Chrome connectivity problems~~
- ~~Unreliable speech recognition~~
- ~~Browser compatibility issues~~

### ✅ New Architecture Benefits
- **Reliable audio streaming** through Daily.co infrastructure
- **Professional STT** using OpenAI Whisper (99%+ accuracy)
- **No browser dependencies** for speech recognition
- **Consistent performance** across all browsers
- **Real-time audio processing** with chunked streaming

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```bash
# Existing variables (keep these)
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_key_here
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key_here

# NEW REQUIRED: OpenAI for Whisper STT
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## 🔑 Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file
5. **Important**: Add billing information to your OpenAI account (Whisper is very affordable - ~$0.006 per minute)

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Audio Capture
- Daily.co captures high-quality audio from your microphone
- Audio is streamed in real-time chunks (1-second intervals)
- No dependency on browser speech recognition

### 2. Speech-to-Text Processing
- Audio chunks are sent to backend `/api/speech-to-text` endpoint
- OpenAI Whisper processes audio with 99%+ accuracy
- Transcripts are returned in real-time to the frontend

### 3. AI Response & TTS
- Final transcripts are sent to your AI (Gemini) for processing
- AI responses are converted to speech using Cartesia
- Audio is played back through Daily.co infrastructure

## 🚀 Testing the Setup

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check the health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "voiceChatEnabled": true,
     "dailyConfigured": true,
     "sttEnabled": true
   }
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

4. **Test voice chat:**
   - Click "Connect Voice Chat" 
   - Grant microphone permissions
   - Try speaking - you should see real-time transcription
   - AI should respond with voice

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```
OpenAIError: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing
```
**Solution**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here` to `backend/.env`

### STT Not Working
- Check backend logs for "🎤 Processing audio chunk for STT"
- Verify OpenAI API key has billing enabled
- Check audio chunk size (should be > 1000 bytes)

### Daily.co Connection Issues
- Verify `DAILY_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Daily.co dashboard for room creation
- Look for "✅ Daily.co room created" in backend logs

### Audio Quality Issues
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check for background noise (Whisper handles this well)
- Verify audio chunks are being sent (check network tab)

## 📊 Performance & Costs

### OpenAI Whisper Pricing
- **$0.006 per minute** of audio processed
- Example: 1 hour of voice chat = ~$0.36
- Very affordable for most use cases

### Daily.co Usage
- Audio-only calls are much cheaper than video
- Excellent global infrastructure
- Built-in echo cancellation and noise reduction

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add your OpenAI API key** to `backend/.env`
2. **Restart the backend** to pick up the new configuration
3. **Test the voice chat** - it should work much more reliably now
4. **Monitor usage** through OpenAI and Daily.co dashboards

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Whisper Model Options
You can modify the STT processing in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
// Current settings (optimized for real-time)
const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: audioStream,
  model: 'whisper-1',        // Fast, accurate model
  language: 'en',            // English optimization
  response_format: 'text'    // Simple text output
});
```

### Audio Chunk Size
Adjust in `src/components/VoiceChatDaily.js`:
```javascript
mediaRecorder.start(1000); // 1 second chunks (current)
// mediaRecorder.start(500);  // 0.5 second chunks (more responsive)
// mediaRecorder.start(2000); // 2 second chunks (more efficient)
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you should see:

**Backend Logs:**
```
✅ Cartesia client initialized successfully
Server is running on port 3001
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Set (Whisper STT enabled)
- DAILY_API_KEY: Set (Daily.co enabled)
🏠 Creating Daily.co room...
✅ Created Daily.co room via API
🎤 Processing audio chunk for STT
🧠 Processing audio with OpenAI Whisper...
✅ Whisper transcription result: [your speech]
```

**Frontend Behavior:**
- Smooth connection to Daily.co
- Real-time transcript updates
- Clear AI voice responses
- No "network" errors

Your voice chat should now be **production-ready** and **highly reliable**! 🎉
